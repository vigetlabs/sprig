Seed Rails application by convention, not configuration.

Provides support for common files types: *csv*, *yaml*, and *json*.  Extensible for the rest!

Learn more about Sprig and view documentation at [http://vigetlabs.github.io/sprig/](http://vigetlabs.github.io/sprig/).

## Installation

Add into your Gemfile
```ruby
gem "sprig"
```
Use `rails generate sprig:install` to create environment-specific and shared seed directories.

## The Sprig Directive

Within your seed file, you can use the `sprig` directive to initiate Sprig's dark magicks. A simple directive might look like this.

```ruby
# seeds.rb

include Sprig::Helpers

sprig [User, Post, Comment]

For shared seeds:
sprig_shared [User, Post, Comment]
```

This directive tells Sprig to go find your datafiles for the `User`, `Post`, and `Comment` seed resources, build records from the data entries, and insert them into the database. Sprig will automatically detect known datafile types like `.yml`, `.json`, or `.csv` within your environment-specific seed directory.

## Environment

Seed files are unique to the environment in which your Rails application is running. Within `db/seeds` create an environment-specific directory (i.e. `/development` for your 'development' environment).

### Shared

Shared seed files default directory is `shared` (eg `db/seeds/shared`)
You can change it by settings`

To insert env specific together with shared seeds use:
```ruby
sprig [User]
sprig_shared [User]
```
This will insert `:env/users` and `shared/users` seeds

## Seed files

Hang your seed definitions on a `records` key for *yaml* and *json* files.

Examples:

```yaml
# users.yml

records:
  - sprig_id: 1
    first_name: 'Lawson'
    last_name: 'Kurtz'
    username: 'lawdawg'
  - sprig_id: 'ryan' # Note: Sprig IDs can be integers or strings
    first_name: 'Ryan'
    last_name: 'Foster'
    username: 'mc_rubs'
```

```json
// posts.json

{
  "records":[
    {
      "sprig_id":1,
      "title":"Json title",
      "content":"Json content"
    },
    {
      "sprig_id":2,
      "title":"Headline",
      "content":"Words about things"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each seed record needs a `sprig_id` defined that must be *unique across all seed files per class*.  It can be an integer, string, whatever you prefer; as long as it is unique, Sprig can sort your seeds for insertion and detect any cyclic relationships.

### Relationships

Create relationships between seed records with the `sprig_record` helper:

```yaml
# comments.yml

records:
  - sprig_id: 1
    post_id: "<%= sprig_record(Post, 1).id %>"
    body: "Yaml Comment body"
```

#### Has and Belongs to Many
For `has_and_belongs_to_many` (HABTM) relationships, you may define relation ids in array format. So if `Post` `has_and_belongs_to_many :tags`, you could write:
```yaml
# posts.yml

records:
  - sprig_id: 42
    title: 'All About Brains'
    content: 'Lorem ipsum...'
    tag_ids:
      - '<%= sprig_record(Tag, 1).id %>'
      - '<%= sprig_record(Tag, 2).id %>'
```
```yaml
# tags.yml

records:
  - sprig_id: 'bio'
    name: 'Biology'
  - sprig_id: 'neuro'
    name: 'Neuroscience'
```
**Note: For namespaced or STI classes, you'll need to include the namespace with the class name in the seed file name. For example `Users::HeadManager` would need to be `users_head_managers.yml`**

### Special Options

These are provided in a `options:` key for *yaml* and *json* files.

#### find_existing_by:

Rather than starting from a blank database, you can optionally choose to find existing records and update them with seed data.

The passed in attribute or array of attributes will be used for finding existing records during the sprigging process.

Example:

```yaml
# posts.yml

options:
  find_existing_by: ['title', 'user_id']
```

### Computed Values

It's common to want seed values that are dynamic.  Sprig supports an ERB style syntax for computing seed attributes.

```yaml
# posts.yml

records:
  - sprig_id: 1
    body: "Yaml Post body"
    published_at: "<%= 1.week.ago %>"
```

## Custom Sources and Parsers

If all your data is in `.wat` files, fear not. You can tell Sprig where to look for your data, and point it toward a custom parser class for turning your data into records. The example below tells Sprig to read `User` seed data from a Google Spreadsheet, and parse it accordingly.

```ruby
require 'open-uri'

fanciness = {
  :class  => User,
  :source => open('https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/somerandomtoken/1/public/values?alt=json'),
  :parser => Sprig::Parser::GoogleSpreadsheetJson
}

sprig [
  fanciness,
  Post,
  Comment
]
```

## Configuration

When Sprig conventions don't suit, just add a configuration block to your seed file.

```ruby
Sprig.configure do |c|
  c.directory = 'seed_files'
  c.shared_directory = 'shared'
end
```

## Populate Seed Files from Database

Want to create Sprig seed files from the records in your database? Well,
[Sprig::Reap](https://rubygems.org/gems/sprig-reap) can create them for you! Check out the gem's
[README](https://github.com/vigetlabs/sprig-reap#sprigreap) for installation instructions and
details on usage.
